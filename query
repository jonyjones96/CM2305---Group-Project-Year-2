# I could not find another way to query the DNS other than using the built-in function of BIND, I guess this is the limitation.
# The following is how to query a "value"(IP address) by having a "Domain_Name"

# lookup a specific host
nslookup www.example.com
# get MX and NS records for the domain
nslookup -type=ANY example.com
# get SOA record and display all nslookup default parameters
nslookup -all -type=SOA example.com

#Example:
nslookup www.example.com
# will return
Server: ns1.example.com
Address: 192.168.2.53

Name: www.example.com
Address: 192.168.2.80


#To check if a server host exists, use:
nslookup 192.168.2.80     #The IP is representing a server, change it accordingly
